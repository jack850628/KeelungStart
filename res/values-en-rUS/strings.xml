        <item>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tai’an Waterfall is set in the heart of Caolan Mountain in Qidu. This fall is also known as Caolan Mountain Waterfall, creating a beautiful sight as it cascades down the cliff. \n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The forest in the mountain area is well-preserved as it is head water protection forest. A tiny fall pours down from mossy rocks and forms a green pond with fishes swimming.\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next to the waterfall are the picnic area and barbecues area for visitors to enjoy themselves. In summer, visitors can enjoy the cold water. On one hand, you can walk up the mountain footpath near the waterfall to immerse you are in the forest. As the forest is located in the inland, mountains protect it from the influence of monsoon, making it beautiful and pleasing all year round. In the hinterland of Keelung, the district is less affected by the northeast monsoon than other parts if the city and has a pleasant climate throughout the year. \n Service Tel : \n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 0224287664 \n Address of attraction : \n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the end of Tai’an Rd., Qidu Dist., Keelung City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)</item>
